at the end of each day
awakens a new beginning 
christened by the setting sun
and the melting of the sky into the horizon
as the stars rise
and reveal a new era of twilight
night and day persist
ever-changing, yet ever-present 
just as day gives way to night
and dawn blends into dusk
life continues 
with the ebb and flow of time
as the planet spins along through the universe
we rise again each day
